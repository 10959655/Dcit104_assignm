x = range (0,10,2)
y = sum(x)
z = len(x)
b = y/z
print (b)


#The 0 and 10 in the interval for the x values and the 2 is the increament. I then went ahead to add and cout them with sum and len method. Finding average, I divided the sum 
#which is the  y by the number of values which is z and printed out as b.
